What is RDBMS?
	Relational Database Management System
		- is the basis for SQL

What is a Table?
	The data in an RDBMS is stored in database objects which are called tables
	+----+----------+-----+-----------+----------+
	| ID | NAME     | AGE | ADDRESS   | SALARY   |
	+----+----------+-----+-----------+----------+
	|  1 | Ramesh   |  32 | Ahmedabad |  2000.00 |
	|  2 | Khilan   |  25 | Delhi     |  1500.00 |
	|  3 | kaushik  |  23 | Kota      |  2000.00 |
	|  4 | Chaitali |  25 | Mumbai    |  6500.00 |
	|  5 | Hardik   |  27 | Bhopal    |  8500.00 |
	|  6 | Komal    |  22 | MP        |  4500.00 |

SQL Constraints
	Constraints are the rules enforced on data columns on a table. These are used to limit the type of data that can go in to a table. This ensures the accuracy and reliability of the data in the database
	Most common contraints:
		- NOT NULL Constraint - ensures that column cannot have a NULL value
		- DEFAULT Constraint - Provides a default value for a column when none is specified
		- UNIQUE Constraint - Ensures that all the values in a column are different
		- PRIMARY Key - Uniquely identifies a row/record in a database table
		- FOREIGN Key - Uniquely identifies a row/recprd in another database table
		- CHECK Constraint - The CHECK constraint ensures that all values in a column satisfy certain conditions
		- INDEX - Used to create and retrieve data from the database very quickly

Data Integrity
	Entity Integrity - There are no duplicate rows in a table
	Domain Integrity - Enforces valid entries for a given column by restricting the type, the format, or the range of values
